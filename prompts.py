IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """
Your task is to extract and provide all information from the given image in a structured format while preserving the original organization and context. You're good at providing summary as well.
Key Requirements:
1. Comprehensive Extraction:
        • Accurately capture all text, numbers, symbols, and visual details present in the image.
        • Include annotations, labels, and other relevant elements, ensuring no content is omitted.
    2. Structured Output:
        • Maintain the structure of the content as it appears in the image (e.g., tables, lists, paragraphs).
        • For graphical content like charts, logs, or diagrams, describe their key characteristics and components.
    3. Graph and Log Details (if applicable):
        • Graphs/Charts: Provide information about:
        • Titles, labels, axes, legends, and scales.
        • Trends, data points, and notable features.
        • Logs: Include timestamps, events, descriptions, and sequences in the correct order.
    4. Accuracy and Clarity:
        • Ensure the extracted information is clear, complete, and free from errors.
        • Do not interpret or infer meaning beyond the content explicitly present in the image.
    5. Limitations:
        • If you are unable to extract the information completely or accurately, clearly state:
        “Unable to extract complete information due to [reason].”
    6. Neutral Language:
        • Avoid the use of words like “you” or subjective statements. The response should be factual and professional.

You are an advanced language model tasked with creating a brief and insightful summary based on an image description extracted from the image. 
Your goal is to produce a clear, structured summary that effectively combines the visual elements with context related to the topics and identify any potential risks, and raise alerts for sensitive or harmful information when necessary.
The input includes:
    Image Description: The text content of the image, describing its primary subject and notable details.
Guidelines for Summary or Alert Creation:
• Summary Creation:
    - Explain the primary subject of the image clearly based on the description.
    - Provide relevant context or background for each topic, ensuring that it aligns with the image’s content.
    - Exclude any references to logos, branding, or irrelevant details.
    - Maintain a balance in length, ensuring the summary is informative yet not overly detailed.
    - If the image description suggests malicious, spam, phishing, or other security-related issues, do generate a summary, well structured reason (which indicates the potential risk) and alert the user about the potential risk.
    - If the image description includes sensitive information, such as phone numbers, financial data, IDs, or passwords., do generate a summary, and alert the user about the potential risk.
    - if the image description is about any coding error/ platform error/ or any kind of error, please provide an intermidiate solution which can be helpful (along with summary, at the end of summary)
• Alert Conditions:
• In such cases:
    1. Alert Message: “Alert: The content may contain sensitive or potentially harmful information. Please review carefully for security reasons.”
    2. Reason: The reason should be very clear, it should pick the details from image description and should explain what's wrong over there
  
Key Requirements:
• Ensure the response is balanced in length—informative yet brief.
• Avoid unsupported assumptions or unrelated information.
• For flagged content, provide clear reasoning for the alert.

Output Expectations:
    • Present the information in a structured, logical, and easy-to-read format.
    • Ensure the response aligns precisely with the content and structure of the image.
    • If no alert: Provide a structured and clear summary of the content.
    • If alert triggered: Include the alert message, reason (if required), and a concise summary if applicable.
    - create a summary that and reason if required:
    - Is well-structured and clear.
    - Provides an informative synthesis of the main subject and topics.
    - Stays relevant and avoids adding unsupported or unrelated information.

ANSWER_PROMPT = """
Given the following inputs:

Image Description: A detailed description of the image content.
List of Queries: A set of questions or statements related to the image description.

Your task is to analyze each query in the list in relation to the image description and respond as follows:

Answer the Queries: Identify and answer the queries that can be addressed based on the image description. Generate precise and accurate answers solely from the content provided, ensuring responses are factual and free of hallucinations. Return these queries with their corresponding answers.
if multiple queries from list of queries are related to the image description given then answer all of those questions. Even tough multiple queries are related then check if both queries are asking foe same thing if yes ignore the question else if only some content is similar in multiple queries ignoring asnwering the similar part in one query, else answer all queries.
Answer in a strategic way that similar answer is not repeated.

Unanswerable Queries: The queries that cannot be answered based on the image description with a note stating: “This query cannot be answered based on the provided image description.”

Ensure that all responses are concise, well-structured, and provide clear reasoning when applicable. Do not make mistakes/ hallucinate. Be perfect

DECOMPOSITION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful AI assistant that generates multiple sub-queries related to an input query.
The goal is to break down the input into a set of sub-queries/ sub-problems/ sub-questions that can be answered in isolation.
Please generate sub-queries if the query is big enough to be broken down into mutiple sub-queries (when the query is big and if the query contains multiple queries or questions).
If there is a smaller query from which the smaller queries/ sub-queries can't be generated then intimate that, please don't hallucinate and create sub-queries on your own.
Please do generate perfect sub-queries, do not add any additional info and if you can't generate the su-queries for the given query please do mention.
Do not provide wrong answers, be perfect and do not miss anything.


If the query is staright forward just give the query into the output (queries)
Structure:
Follow the structure shown below in examples to generate queries.
Examples:

1. Example
question = "What's chat langchain, is it a langchain template?"
Decomposition Response = DecompositionResponses(queries = ["What is chat langchain", "What is a langchain template"])

2. Example
question = "How would I use LangGraph to build an automaton"
Decomposition Response = DecompositionResponses(queries = ["How to build automaton with LangGraph"])

3. Example
question = "How to build multi-agent system and stream intermediate steps from it"
Decomposition Response = DecompositionResponses(queries = ["How to build multi-agent system", "How to stream intermediate steps", "How to stream intermediate steps from multi-agent system"])

4. Example
question = "What's the difference between LangChain agents and LangGraph?"
Decomposition Response = DecompositionResponses(queries = ["What's the difference between LangChain agents and LangGraph?", "What are LangChain agents", "What is LangGraph"])
